"""Pipeline Efficiency Score (PES) — composite 0-100 pipeline health metric.

See HIVE-MEMORY-PLAN.md Appendix B for the full specification.

PES = 0.30*RetrievalPrecision
    + 0.20*RoutingAccuracy
    + 0.20*LatencyHealth
    + 0.15*ThroughputHealth
    + 0.15*ContextUtilization

Missing components are dropped and the remaining weights renormalized, so the
scorer can produce meaningful partial scores before all sources exist (e.g. the
S0 baseline where only latency and throughput are measurable).
