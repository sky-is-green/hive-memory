"""Gatekeeper interop seam.

Where Gatekeeper Studio already solves a problem (endpoint resolution, confidence
calibration, reliability tracking, safe config merge), the hive consumes the
documented HOST-SEAM JSON shapes rather than re-implementing the logic.

The full HOST-SEAM.md contract is not present in this repo, so this seam provides
defaults and a single place to wire real Gatekeeper values when available. It
never reaches into Gatekeeper internals.
