"""Guards for the repo layout.

The repo is split into `hive/` (the system), `hivebench/` (the evaluation
suite) and `harness/` (the HiveBench Studio sidecar) with flat top-level
import names. These tests pin the invariants the restructure depends on: no
stray package dirs at the root, pyproject declaring all three trees, the vocab
data present next to `sieve`, and the test runner's path constants resolving.
